sql_upper
=========

This is a simple Python script that will make all SQL keywords upper cased
in each file passed on the command line.

It will not overwrite existing files and instead creates a file with a .NEW
extension.  Make sure to include the keywords.txt file in the same directory
when running the script.

Use this script freely and fork it if you can make it better.
